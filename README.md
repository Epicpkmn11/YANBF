CTR-NDSForwarder
=======

nds-bootstrap forwarder template that is installed as a 3DS homebrew, to allow for more than 40 forwarders.

How to use:
  1. Download release zip
  1. Extract release zip
  1. Copy all files in `for SD card root` to root of SD card
  1. Install all CIAs in `cia` folder
  1. Get Python 3 for your PC
  1. `pip install Pillow requests`
  1. `python3 generator.py <path to ROM on SD>`

To build:
  1. figure out a way to put `make_cia` in PATH. Will find a better way to deal with this soonâ„¢
  1. edit `romFS:/path.txt` to any file path in `sd:/`
  1. run `make dist`
  1. install both CIAs
  1. extract sdcard.nds to `sdmc:/_nds/CTR-NDSForwarder/sdcard.nds`
  1. voila

Current issues:
  - `make_cia` needs to be in PATH. I should probably not do that
    - UNIX requires even more to be in path, such as `makerom` and `bannertool`
  - code is very messy and will make you cry
  - no actual way to grab cheats at the moment, or rather, I have no idea how to adapt the existing code to do so
  - no banner. That's next up

Credits:
  - [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) for their toolchain and BootStrap
  - [RocketRobz](https://github.com/RocketRobz/NTR_Forwarder) for the forwarder source code
  - [Universal-Team members](https://github.com/Universal-Team) for dealing with my terrible questions and Epicpkmn11 for testing
  - [aspargas2](https://github.com/aspargas2) for basic python:tm:
  - probably more to come soon because this code isn't even complete yet
